	This thesis investigates the propagation of locally injected turbulence within a doubly periodic 2D domain. Numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations are conducted with localized zero-mean forcing applied. Additionally, a point vortex model is employed to compare vortex evolution between the two approaches. The results demonstrate that the energy carried by vortices spreads across the domain, as opposed to previous works in 3D domains, and reaches domain boundaries regardless of the size of the perturbation region if the Reynolds number is sufficiently high. A power law for the enstrophy distribution as a function of distance from the forcing region is identified, which is also consistent with the results found in the point vortex model.
