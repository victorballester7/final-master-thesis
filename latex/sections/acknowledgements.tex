\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would not like to finish this project without thanking the people who have helped me along the way. First and foremost, I would like to thank my two supervisors, Prof.\ Alexandros Alexakis and Prof.\ Emmanuel Dormy, for their guidance and constant support throughout the project. This project was, in the theoretical perspective, a bit far from my previous works, but their continuous help and advice made it possible. I would also like to thank the whole group led by Professor Stéphan Fauve in the Laboratoire de Physique de l'École Normale Supérieure, for giving me a desk and a place to work during my internship. Finally, I appreciate the huge amount of time and resources that both supercomputer centers, IDRIS and MESOPSL, have provided me during the development of this project. Without their technological resources, this project would have been impossible to carry out.
